  <h2>Cities I've lived in</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up in Randolph, but moved to Evanston for college. I ended up in Berkeley
    after receiving a fellowship to work for the prop department at Berkeley Repertory
    Theatre. I moved to El Cerrito when my fellowship ended and sadly had to leave the
    theatre's free housing to start paying my own bills. I finally moved to Oakland,
    because of my roommates' drama-filled relationship.
